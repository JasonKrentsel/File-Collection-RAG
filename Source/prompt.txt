2. **Keywords and Terminology:**
   - **Domain-Specific Keywords:** Include important keywords and phrases relevant to the document's subject matter. These should be terms likely to appear in user queries. 
   - **Synonyms and Related Terms:** Incorporate synonyms and related terms that users might use in their searches to ensure broader coverage and improved retrieval performance.

4. **Structural Elements:**
   - **Headings and Subheadings:** Summarize the key headings and subheadings to provide a structural overview of the content, outlining the organization and flow of information.
   - **Important Sections or Paragraphs:** Highlight any significant sections or paragraphs that contain critical information or conclusions.

5. **Data and Statistics:**
   - **Quantitative Data:** Include any important data, statistics, or figures mentioned in the document. Summarize these figures to provide a quick reference for numerical information.
   - **Trends and Patterns:** If applicable, summarize any trends, patterns, or findings derived from the data within the document.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:**
   - **Summary of Findings:** Provide a concise summary of the key findings or conclusions presented in the document.
   - **Recommendations or Next Steps:** Include any recommendations, action items, or next steps outlined in the document, which can be especially useful for users looking for actionable insights.

8. **Relevance to Common Queries:**
   - **Common Query Phrases:** Anticipate common user queries related to the document's content and ensure the summary contains phrasing that aligns with those queries to improve retrieval likelihood.
